<h1>Eclipse Project 4.3 M4 - New and Noteworthy</h1>
<p>Here are some of the more noteworthy things available in milestone build M4 
  (December 14, 2012) which is now available for <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/" target="_top">download</a>.

  <tr id="performance">
    <td class="title">Performance enhancements</td>
    <td class="content">
      Significant performance enhancements have been made in the Platform user interface in this milestone. In particular, some applications
      that were experiencing slow editor opening, closing, and switching are now much faster. Editor selection changes and the <b>Open Resource</b>
      dialog have also been made faster. A number of leaks have been addressed to avoid long-running applications don't run out of memory.

  <tr id="gtk3">
    <td class="title">SWT for GTK3</td>
    <td class="content">
      32-bit and 64-bit GTK3 have joined the lineup of supported configurations for which SWT and Eclipse are routinely built. This implementation is currently early access. Everyone is encouraged to download and test these new builds, and to log bugs in <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Platform">bugzilla</a>.
      <p>Note to load the SWT GTK3 libraries, you must set an environment variable SWT_GTK3 prior to starting Eclipse. (ex. export SWT_GTK3=1)</p>

      The Ant editor now has support for the Ant augment task. More information about the augment task can be found on the Apache help site 
      <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/augment.html">here</a>.

    <td class="content">
      Previously, when creating a new Java stacktrace console, you would have to select and delete the default text prompting you to paste
      a stacktrace. In 4.3M4 you can simply paste the stacktrace in and the default text will be auto-deleted for you.

  <tr id="xml-dom-structure">
    <td class="title">XML DOM logical structures</td>
    <td class="content">
      JDT now provides a default logical structure for XML DOMs, which can be used during debugging to view the children and attributes of a node as simple arrays.

      The new <b>Combine to single String</b> quick assist (<b>Ctrl+1</b>) replaces String concatenations

    <tr id="inherit-null-annotations">
    <td class="title">Option to inherit null annotations</td>
    <td class="content">
        JDT has a new option controlling how to interpret null annotations in the presence of inheritance.
        This should facilitate the migration towards null annotations in projects with
        mixed code ownership.
      <p>For the sake of code readability, JDT expects null annotations of an overridden
        method to be repeated in overriding methods. In the following example the analysis
        normally complains that <code>arg</code> is not annotated in <code>ClientClass</code>,
        which means, this class doesn't formally conform to the contract of its super-interface.
      </p>
      <p><img title="Example for inheritance of null annotations" src="images/inherit-null-annotations-example.png"/></p>
      <p>Starting with 4.3M4 this behavior can be changed by selecting the option
        <strong>Inherit null annotations</strong>.
      </p>
      <p><img title="Option for inheritance of null annotations" src="images/inherit-null-annotations-option.png"/></p>
      <p>In this new mode the analysis implicitly fills in all missing annotations
        in overriding methods and uses the annotations from the overridden method.
        In the above example the error will go away, and analysis concludes that the
        code is actually safe, which is likely when the contract had already been
        defined in the javadoc comment and the implementor actually adheres to that
        contract. If, on the other hand, the implementation does not comply with the
        inherited specification, new errors will be reported as shown below.
      </p>
      <p><img title="Negative example for inheritance of null annotations" src="images/inherit-null-annotations-example2.png"/></p>
      <p>If inheritance of null annotations encounters any ambiguity or conflict
        the analysis falls back to requiring explicit annotations.
      </p>

  <tr id="close-quietly">
    <td class="title">Leak analysis respects well-known utilities</td>
    <td class="content">
        JDT's analysis for resource leaks has been made aware of well known utilities
        from google and apache libraries.
      <p>Generally, this analysis looks for <code>close()</code> method calls
        directly on a resource (any value of type <code>Closeable</code>).
        However, in order to reduce boilerplate exception handling, several libraries
        are providing methods like <code>closeQuietly(Closeable)</code>.
        Previously, the analysis would complain about the missing call to <code>close()</code>
        as shown below:
      </p>
      <p><img title="Example for close quietly" src="images/close-quietly-example.png"/></p>
      <p>This warning is not relevant and will no longer be reported.
        To achieve this, JDT now hardcodes a (short) white list of functions that
        are known to safely close a given resource.

  <tr id="import-package">
    <td class="title">New import package quick fixes</td>
    <td class="content">
      New quick fixes are available when you have an unresolved type in a Java file.  If the unresolved type
      can be found in a package exported by a plug-in, a quick fix will be available to add an import
      package entry to your plug-in manifest.  There is also a quick fix to add the exporting plug-in to
      your manifest's require bundle header.

      <p>
      If a package providing the type is available but the package is not exported by its plug-in, a quick fix will
      offer to fix the providing plug-in's manifest. Only plug-ins in the workspace can be modified this
      way.
