  <tr id="migrationWizard">
    <td class="title">Migration Wizard</td>
    <td class="content">
     Building on the changes introduced in M5 to detect changes in shared installs, Eclipse now includes a migration wizard to help users through the re-ininstallation of their plug-ins.
	 <p>This wizard is presented in two situations. First, when a read-only installation of Eclipse is being changed (i.e. Eclipse is being updated or plugins are added / remove), second when a new read-only installation of Eclipse is run for the first time.</p>

     New API has been added to allow text direction to be set independent of the widget orientation. For more info see <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/tree/examples/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/src/org/eclipse/swt/snippets/Snippet364.java">Snippet 364</a>.

     Ever encountered a long <code>if</code> statement that can be safely inverted to an early return, so that you can ignore the code that follows, and make it easier to understand? 
     Now, you can just use a Quick Assist <b>(Ctrl+1)</b> on the <code>if</code> statement to do this refactoring:

      <p>
        At the same time, our good old friend org.junit_3.8.2 has been retired, and the org.junit4 compatibility bundle
        has also been removed. Your <code>Require-Bundle:</code> entries should just point to
        <code>org.junit;bundle-version="4.11.0"</code> (or an earlier version, if you like).
      </p>
      <p>Note that JUnit 4 still contains the JUnit 3 APIs. If you need org.junit_3.8.2 back for
        whatever reason, you can still get it from <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/">Orbit</a>.

  <tr id="debug-improved-generics-eval">
   <td class="title">Improved evaluation of generics while debugging</td>
   <td class="content">
     Significant improvements have been made in the debug evaluation engine to support the use of
     generics. This impacts the use of conditional breakpoints, the display view, the expressions view,
     and the inspect/display/execute actions. Previously, evaluations acting on classes with generics
     would sometimes encounter compilation errors.

   <td class="content">
     JDT Debug now provides an extension point <code>org.eclipse.jdt.launching.libraryLocationResolvers</code>
     that you can use to contribute location information for non-standard JRE / JDK libraries.  For example,
     this extension point can be used to provide Javadoc and source locations for JARs in the ext location
     of a JRE.
     <p>
     Extenders must provide an implementation of <code>org.eclipse.jdt.launching.ILibraryLocationResolver</code>
     which can provide package roots, source paths, Javadoc locations and index locations for a library.

  <tr id="api-unresolved-bundles">
   <td class="title">API Tools Analysis and Freeze tasks can run with unresolved bundles</td>
   <td class="content">
	 The API Tools <b>Analysis</b> and <b>API Freeze</b> Ant tasks will now process bundles
	 with resolver errors such as missing dependencies.  This means you can now get analysis results
	 for an incomplete product.
	 <p>
     The Ant tasks produce reports based on a reference baseline and a profile.  Previously both 
     the baseline and the profile had to describe complete products.  Any bundle that had resolver 
     errors due to missing dependencies would be skipped.  Now these bundles will be processed.
     </p>
     <p>
     Resolver errors can affect the results, therefore a list of resolver errors is included in the XML output
     and warnings are added to the HTML report. To return to the old behavior of skipping
     unresolved bundles, you can set <code>processunresolvedbundles="false"</code> on your Ant task.
