<h1>Eclipse Project 4.4 M5 - New and Noteworthy</h1>
<p>Here are some of the more noteworthy things available in milestone build M5 
  (January 24, 2014) which is now available for <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/" target="_top">download</a>.
  <br/>
  We also recommend to read the Tips and Tricks, either via <b>Help &gt; Tips and Tricks...</b> or online for
  <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tips/platform_tips.html">Platform</a>,
  <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tips/jdt_tips.html">JDT</a>, and

     <tr id="minimized-stack-option"> 
    <td class="title">New option for minimized stacks</td>
    <td class="content">
    We've extended the MinMaxAddon to have two different display modes:
    <ul>
    <li>Use Overlays: This is the current mode where showing a view in a
    minimized stack opens it in a 'fly out', overlaying part of the
    presentation.</li>
    <li>Show in the Original Location: This is a new mode that will temporarily put the
    stack back into the perspective layout while one of its views is active. This
    has the advantage that the minimized view won't overlay anything in the
    current presentation (e.g. your editor...).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In order to access the new mode, right-click on the <b>Restore</b> button
    of a minimized stack and select the <b>Show in the Original Location</b> menu item (see image
    below). Note that this change is global, so once it's set, all minimized
    stacks will use the selected mode.</p>

    <p>Here's what the current mode looks like:</p>
    <p><img src="images/use-overlays.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p>Here's what the new mode looks like. Note how the editor
    has been pushed to the right rather than being obscured:</p>
    <p><img src="images/no-overlays.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p>
    We're really interested in your feedback on this! The initial response
    has been positive enough that we're considering making the non-overlay
    mode the default. What do you think? (Post your comments on <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=426556">bug 426556</a>).

  <tr id="workspaceLock">
    <td class="title">Removed WorkspaceLock API</td>
    <td class="content">
      The <code>WorkspaceLock</code> API allowed a special client (usually Platform UI) to
      hook into the locking protocols used by the workspace implementation. This hook
      was used to mitigate deadlocks due to interaction with synchronous SWT events,
      and was never intended to be used by other clients. In the 3.0 release this API
      was deprecated in favor of a more general API provided by the <code>org.eclipse.core.jobs</code>
      bundle. Invoking this API has had no effect since the 3.0 release. The specific API
      being removed includes:
      <ul>
        <li>The <code>org.eclipse.core.resources.WorkspaceLock</code> class.</li>
        <li>The method <code>org.eclipse.core.resources.IWorkspace#setWorkspaceLock</code></li>
      </ul>
      Clients that directly use an API listed above should remove any references to it.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="incrementalProjectBuilder-getRule">
    <td class="title">Removed IncrementalProjectBuilder#getRule() API</td>
    <td class="content">
      The <code>IncrementalProjectBuilder#getRule()</code> method returned a scheduling rule 
      that was required for building the project by the builder. This method was intended to be used by the builder framework only.
      In the 3.6 release this method was deprecated in favor of a more general method <code>IncrementalProjectBuilder#getRule(int, Map)</code>. 
      The specific API being removed includes:
      <ul>
        <li>The method <code>org.eclipse.core.resources.IncrementalProjectBuilder#getRule()</code></li>
      </ul>
      Clients that directly call the API listed above should remove any references to it
      or replace them with calls to <code>IncrementalProjectBuilder#getRule(int, Map)</code>. Clients that implement the API listed
      above should implement <code>IncrementalProjectBuilder#getRule(int, Map)</code> instead.

  <tr id="swt-gtk-problem"> 
    <td class="title">SWT does not work on Linux with GTK+ 3 version &gt; 3.8.x</td>
    <td class="content">
        The Linux GTK+ 3 port of SWT is currently broken for GTK+ versions above 3.8.x.
        This primarily affects users running Fedora 20, Ubuntu 14.04 (Alpha builds), openSUSE 13.1 and any other Linux distributions that bundle GTK+ 3.10.x.
        As a workaround, users are advised to switch back to GTK+ 2 by setting the environment variable <code>SWT_GTK3</code> to <code>0</code>.

  <tr id="sleep-monitor-api"> 
    <td class="title">Added API for sleep monitoring</td>
    <td class="content">
        SWT has added two new events, <code>SWT.Sleep</code> and <code>SWT.Wakeup</code>,
        which are sent before the <code>Display</code> event loop goes into sleep and after
        it wakes up from sleep respectively. These events can e.g. be used to monitor the duration
        of sleep time in SWT applications.
